# How to Run the Todo Application

This guide will help you get the modern todo application up and running in your WebContainer environment.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open the terminal in your WebContainer and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server using this command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **View the Application:**
    The application should automatically open in the preview pane of your WebContainer environment. If it doesn't, look for a local server URL (usually `http://localhost:3000` or similar) in the terminal output and open it manually.

You can now interact with the modern todo application! Add new todos, mark them as complete, and delete them. Your actions will be logged in the notification box at the bottom right.
